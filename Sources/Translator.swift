     - Returns: A new, empty KeyedMetaContainer.
     - Attention: You should implement this method or keep the default implementation of it, even if you do not support keyed containers in you framework, because the documentation of Encodable specifies an empty keyed container as substitute if a value requested a single value container but did not encode anything. Do not use precondition or assert in this method for that reason.
     
         You may for example use the EmptyOnlyKeyedContainerMeta provided by meta-serialization, that will simply do nothing all the time
