# Welcome to the MetaSerialization docs

This is the place where you can find guides about MetaSerialization and documentation for all public types from MetaSerialization generated by [jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy).

A good point to start is `MetaEncoder` or `MetaDecoder`, or reading the guides linked to in this file.
hich MetaSerialization will give you the "go directly into the prision" card/crash.
