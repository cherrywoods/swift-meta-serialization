#  Example2 / Dynamic meta tree unwrapping example

This exaple format is used to test:
 * dynamic meta tree unwrapping 
 * not supporting nil
 * CodingDictionary
 * not supporting first level non container values

## Format

`"["abc", "nine", "fdg", "dada"]"` can be seen as unkeyed container or keyed container with keys "abc" and "fdg".

`"["ghi", ["abc", "def"], "jkl": ["zyx", "wvu"]]"` is another valid example
